# Week 1: Machine Learning overview

**Machine Learning:** gives computer the ability to learn without explicitly programmed.  

## Categories

- Supervised learning:
  - Training data includes both sample input and output.
  - Regression: for output values in continuous space.
  - Classification: for output values in discrete space.
- Unsupervised learning:
  - Training data includes input only.
  - The machine will detect the relationship between inputs, and group them.

## Training data

The machine first learns from the history data, then uses those knowledge to make
prediction.  
E.g. the data of Housing Price. Given the dataset with these information:

- House's number of rooms (input or feature 1)
- House's area (input or feature 2)
- House's price (output)
